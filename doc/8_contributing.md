## contributing

Please before you submit an issue or a pull request, make sure you fulfill the following requirements.

### Issue

[ ] I have provided a description of the issue in English
[ ] I have specified the version of ship-hold I use.
[ ] my issue is a **bug report** or a **feature request**. Please **NO QUESTION** use stackoverflow or the chat (Preferably stackoverflow so the question can be indexed by search engines: ping me by mail whit your SO question link until I have enough reputation to create a tag)
[ ] If it is an issue, provide your models, the sql query (you can use the DEBUG=ship-hold env var to print the query) and the expected sql query if you know it.
[ ] If it is an issue, provide a small data set and the expected result.
[ ] If it is a feature request: keep in mind that ship-hold favors extension module architecture over monolithic module. So your feature request will likely be refused. Don't hesitate to open it though so it may be open to upvote. However, It is not democracy :) !

### pull request

[ ] unless it deals with documentation only, pull request must reference an open issue so we can discuss it before any implementation is done.
[ ] include the referenced issue
[ ] add tests !
[ ] update doc if required (not the readme.md but in the doc folder)

Don't forget to have a look at the tests, there are plenty of examples there !
