    h1#introduction Introduction
    p.
        #[strong ship-hold] is a #[em small] and #[+link('./performances', 'fast')] data access framework
        for #[+link('https://www.postgresql.org', 'Postgres')] relational database system, developed for the
        #[+link('https://nodejs.org/', 'Nodejs')] environment.
    p.
        It is based around intuitive #[+link('./builders','sql query builders')] which mirror closely the SQL syntax
        while keeping the flexibility functions may have.
        It also allows you to create convenient services and relations between them in order to easily query related resources (aka "eager loading").
        It is actually the #[strong only] library I know of which has it right when it comes to pagination and nested pagination !
    p.
        It defers quite a lot from other popular libraries so called #[strong ORM] such
        #[+link('http://docs.sequelizejs.com/', 'Sequelize')] or #[+link('http://bookshelfjs.org/', 'Bookshelf')].
        They usually come with a lot of features
        (schema management, migrations, validations, different sql dialects, model instances, etc) and more complex API's / code base
        (we are usually talking about more than 200 api functions and more than 10/20 thousands of source lines of code).
        However, ship-hold focuses on a limited set of features while remaining extensible (builders are just functions !)
    h2#getting-started Getting started
    h3#installation Installation
    p.
        run in your terminal #[code.shell npm install ship-hold] (assuming you have #[+link('https://npmjs.org', 'npm')] installed)
    h3#initialisation initialisation
    p Pass database connection information to the ship-hold factory

    +codeblock
        include:highlight(lang='javascript') ./snippets/init.js
    p.
        Every option the driver #[+link('https://node-postgres.com','pg')] takes can be passed.
        That's it ! You can start to query your database.

    h2#how-to-read How to read this documentation

    p.
        We recommend first to read the documentation in the order shown by the table of content. Once you are familiar with the different sections you
        can jump directly from one topic to another one as you would do in a #[em API reference] document.

    p.
        It is not mandatory to read the #[+link('performances','performance section')] in order to use ship-hold.
        However we highly recommend it to understand how complex queries are generated and when they should be avoided.

    p.tip.
        All the examples in the documentation use a database defined by the #[+link('annexes','initialization script')] defined in the annexes
