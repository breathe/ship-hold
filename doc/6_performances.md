## Performances

As very light and using stream as base component, ship-hold performs quite well. There is a [benchmark repository](https://github.com/zorro-del-caribe/ship-hold-benchmark) you can clone and modify to test with you own use cases and hardware which test ship-hold and other libraries in "realistic" use cases.
As any benchmark, it has to be taken with a grain of salt and you should do your own testing before making any claim !
